# parkinson-s-diagnosis

Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder with more than 6 million people worldwide
suffering from it.It is commonly diagnosed using clinical assessments and progression scale
which usually depends on the medical practitioner’s expertise ,and accuracy varies greatly
between various examiners which also takes a long time to accurately diagnose.This paper
proposes to develop a computer aided diagnostic method to diagnose PD patients using MRI
images of the brain ,thus reducing cross examiner variability and the time required to accurately
differentiate between PD and Control subjects.
